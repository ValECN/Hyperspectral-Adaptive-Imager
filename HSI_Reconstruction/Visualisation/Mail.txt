Hi, You will find attached an interface based on Tony's work to visualize Hyperspectral data.

To use it you have to
- Call HyperSpectral_Visualization_Interface_2020 from Matlab
- Load an HyperSpectral Object (any .mat file with an HS cube in an "Object" variable)
    You can download such a file there
- You can zoom on a small area ofthe image :
    Click on the "Zoom" Button and select an area on the RGB image with the mouse
- Select a pixel on the RGB image :
    Click on "Pixel Choice" and click on the pixel in the RGB image
    The pixel's spectrum and the (x,w) and (y,w) images will appear
- Select a wavelength :
    Select the Wavelength on the slider or giving a value for W
    or click on "Wavelength choice" Button and select the Wavelength
    on the spectrum or on the (x,w) and (y,w) images

Tell me if it works for you...
